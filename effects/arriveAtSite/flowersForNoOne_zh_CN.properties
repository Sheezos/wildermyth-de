~01~prompt~panel_001~2_leader=Over here. Looks like their tracks alright.
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=In recent weeks, rumors of <foes.plural> have multiplied throughout <overlandTile>. Homesteaders and drifters alike have seen them crossing the wilderness, heading toward the old ruins.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=They haven't caused much trouble... yet. But, as an old farmhand tells <company>, it's best to root out the blight before its poison seeps into your soil.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_mystic=<mystic.bookish/greedy/60:I read about the people here building fortifications. Weird./Heard there was ruins and riches out here.../So the rumors were true...>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_mystic=<mystic.hothead/goofball/snark/60:[face:skeptical]But what do they want with some dusty old ruins?/[face:skeptical]But what's so attractive about some dusty old ruins?/[face:dubious]I suppose these dusty old ruins remind them of home?/I wonder what brought them here of all places?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_leader=Maybe they want to <foes.cdgmt:build a fortress of some kind. Something defensible.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_leader=Good stonework, a solid foundation. Easier than starting from scratch.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_ship=Hmm... make use of what the dead left behind...?
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:They wouldn't be the first./>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_mystic=The dead...
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_mystic=Do you ever think about them? The people who lived in these places?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/bookish/romantic/poet/loner/greedy/hothead/60:Were they ordinary folk like us, trying to build a better world?/Were they a curious people? Hoarders of ancient wisdoms?/Did lovers stand upon these stones, whispering secrets in the starlight?/Were they weavers of song, lovers of beauty?/Were they happy, living in a place like this?/Were they a prosperous people, reveling in life's pleasures?/Were they bold adventurers, lovers of contest and sport?/Were they a happy people? Dreaming of a bright future?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/bookish/romantic/poet/loner/greedy/hothead/60:Hoping their loved ones would be safe behind these walls?/[face:grim]Raising towers to please their gods?/[face:happy]What grand weddings they might've held, beneath these arches./Telling tales to the sky from atop lofty towers?/[face:skeptical]Would they ever feel stifled behind these walls?/[face:happy]Bedecked with jewels, sipping fine wines under gilded canopies?/[face:skeptical]Could we beat them in a fight?/[face:grim]Or were they ruled by fear, building ever thicker walls to keep their enemies at bay?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_mystic=Did they walk these streets, thinking the towers they built would stand forever?
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:dubious]You expect me to answer that, or do you just like talking to yourself?/[face:default]It's fine to ponder. But I don't think we'll ever know the answer./[face:skeptical]Is this really important to you, <mystic>?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_mystic=And what defeated them in the end? Was it war that caused the city to crumble? Or the slow decay of time?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_leader=Alright, enough talk. We don't want the <foes.plural> to hear us coming.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_mystic=<mystic.rfln.ship:[face:grim]Oh forget it. You wouldn't understand./[face:default]Yeah. I guess not./[face:interested]Huh? No, I guess not./--->
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_leader=And anyway, I found something. Behind these stones, looks like a stairwell.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_narration=Down they climb, into the ancient city's underbelly. Slimy things skitter away at their approach. A rancid odor hangs in the air.
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_mystic=Ow! That's my foot you're stepping on.
~01~prompt~panel_017~3_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:skeptical]Really? That lumpy thing?/[face:interested]Oh, sorry. Can't see a thing./Sorry, love. Don't want to lose you in the dark./--->
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_leader=Think I found a torch. <mystic>, would you mind?
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_ship=A tomb?
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_mystic=Must have been someone important.
~01~prompt~panel_022~1_narration=Flowers were once strewn across the floor. Shriveled to husks, most have been crushed to a fine powder beneath trampling feet, mingling with bones and broken offerings.
~01~prompt~panel_023~1_mystic=Everything's been picked through.
~01~prompt~panel_023~2_leader=The <foes.plural> must have discovered this place long ago.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_mystic=This painting... they tore it to shreds to get at the gold in the frame. Ugh. <foes.plural> ruin everything.
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_ship=Uh, guys? About those <foes.plural>...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_leader=Objects are just things. All I want to leave behind is a legacy for the deeds I did and the people I helped.
