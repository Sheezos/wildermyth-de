Nice of them to lead us straight to their hideout./[face:interested]Hmm. They aren't concealing their tracks. Not that I expected much from those clumsy brutes./[face:skeptical]Never seen so many tracks all in one place. Do they know we're coming?/These tracks are fresh. Keep your eyes peeled, folks.>/<leader.goofball/loner/greedy/60:[face:interested]Pretty sure these are terrorbird droppings. Anyone else want a whiff?/[face:grim]Lot of tracks... must be a whole crowd of them./[face:interested]More tracks, and a... tooth? Wonder if there's a market for Drauven teeth?/Tracks are fresh. They must be around here somewhere.>/<leader.bookish/healer/coward/60:[face:skeptical]Ah. They've left a lovely blue trail for us to follow./Step carefully. More of their goo over here./[face:grim]Uck. They sure left a mess... Wonder if they know we're coming?/A trail of that blueish goo. Least it's not hard to follow.>/<leader.goofball/60:[face:happy]Aha! Looks like old rustybones sprang a leak./More tracks here. One of them must've sprung a leak.>/<leader.healer/coward/60:[face:sad]Ugh. Poor rat. Got stuck in one of their webs I guess./[face:interested]Ew. Is that a rat? Their webs are... ugh./Um. Don't look if you're squeamish. A rat, maybe. Stuck in one of their webs.>>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=Rumors of <foes.plural> have led <company> <overlandTile.bghps:through tangled woods/over rippling prairies/over craggy slopes/through tangled woods/through murky bogs> to the ruins of a forgotten city.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=It's nothing special to the eye. Just windworn rocks and crumbling edifice, the names of its builders long lost to time.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_ship=<ship.bookish/greedy/goofball/snark/coward/loner/60:[face:skeptical]The local histories didn't even mention this place./[face:happy]Ancient ruins, hmm. Could be other ancient things, stashed away.../[face:happy]More ruins, huh? Seems like everyone's got a ruin these days./[face:dubious]Another day, another fallen civilization./Kind of eerie, this place./[face:skeptical]Huh. Nice ruins I guess./Didn't think there'd be ruins in a place like this...>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_mystic=<mystic.greedy/bookish/snark/60:[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/>So... what brought the <foes.plural> out here?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/healer/snark/60:Hmm. With what little we know of this place, it's hard to say./[face:interested]Well, I mean, a lot of what they do doesn't make much sense./[face:default]Hard to say. Could be aything, really./[face:skeptical]Huh? Not really sure./Hmm. It's hard to know what goes on in their heads./[face:dubious]With them, who knows?/Hmm. It's hard to say.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_leader=If it was me, though... <leader.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/snark/loner/60:and I wanted a strategic outpost for my <foes.singular> empire.../and I wanted a safe place to defend against... us.../and I wanted a cozy hidey-hole to rest my <foes.singular> feet.../and I wanted a good, safe base to stash my <foes.singular> treasure.../and I needed a base to plan the next stage of my world conquest.../and I wanted a hideout where no one would bother me.../and I was looking to set up a new base for my <foes.singular> empire...>
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_leader=These old ruins seem like a good spot. Stonework's still solid.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_ship=Sure... make use of what the dead left behind.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_volunteer=<volunteer.exists:They wouldn't be the first./>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_mystic=The dead...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_mystic=You ever think about them? I mean the plain, ordinary folk. How they lived their lives.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/bookish/romantic/poet/loner/greedy/hothead/60:Imagine these streets, teeming with life. People smiling and saying good morning./[face:skeptical]This would've been the main roadway. Thousands of feet treading these stones each day./[face:happy]Walking these very streets... lovers exchanging coy glances as they passed each other in the crowds./The people, the lifeblood of this city, flowing over these paved roadways, pulsing and vibrant./[face:skeptical]When these streets were crowded, it would have been stifling./Here on these streets, buying and peddling their goods.../Imagine it... crowds of people laughing, jostling. Bet these streets got wild after nightfall./You can almost see it... these streets, brimming over with life.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/bookish/romantic/poet/loner/greedy/hothead/60:[face:happy]And in these houses, they'd gather with loved ones, rock their children to sleep./And when night fell, they'd retire to one of these houses, to tell stories by a fireside./[face:joy]And when night fell, in these cozy little houses, they'd hold each other close./[face:happy]Until, with night's fall, they retire to their homes, and pass the night in fervent dreaming./But at least the houses seem roomy.../[face:happy]Lush rugs. Colorful beads. Filling their homes with little treasures./[face:happy]Probably had big tournaments in these open spaces. Settled disputes through sport./And these must've been houses, once. A steaming pot on the hearth, little ones crawling on the rug...>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/bookish/romantic/poet/loner/greedy/hothead/60:So many little joys and sorrows, shared between these walls.../The words of those stories once filled the silence between these walls./Between these walls they lived and loved, and strove to better themselves./Their dreams, their aspirations... all born between these walls./Their memories, their thoughts... formed between these walls./All that they cherished, kept close, between these walls./Between these walls they lived and died, fought and made up./Between these walls they lived and died. One generation to the next.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_mystic=<mystic.healer/60:It almost feels... wrong./And now here we are.> Tromping over their roads, hoping to find something of value.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:So, what? You calling us graverobbers?/We're not graverobbers./[face:grim]<mystic>. We're not graverobbers./--->
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_ship=<ship.healer/goofball/romantic/poet/coward/greedy/snark/loner/60:We're trying to help people. Save lives. Sometimes that requires us to make use of what we find. Respectfully./<leader.greedy/60:Well okay, maybe <leader> <mystic.greedy/60:and you are. But the way I see it,/is. But the way I see it,>/The way I see it,> we're the world's janitors. Taking all the stinkiest jobs, squashing all the monster things. So if we find some useful trinket in the refuse, don't we have a right to take it?/<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:angry]///>We're the heroes trying to fend off evil hordes, to keep the people of these lands safe. If we find something along the way that will help us tip the scales, don't we have a duty to take it?/We tread these stones for the sake of the living, pitting ourselves against swelling hordes. It's no dishonor to the dead if we take what they can't use, to aid us in our fight./I mean, we're not here to dishonor the dead. We're after the <foes.plural>... and, uh, we don't even know if we can beat them. So, if we find anything useful along the way, wouldn't it be smart to take it?/<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:angry]/[face:interested]/[face:grim]/>We're here to rid this place of <foes.plural>. And yeah, if we find something valuable along the way, we might take it. Why shouldn't we?/<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:dubious]/[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]/><leader.greedy/60:Well, maybe <leader> <mystic.greedy/60:and you are. But the way I see it,/is. But the way I see it,>/The way I see it,> we're the world's janitors. Taking all the stinkiest, most thankless jobs. So if we find some useful trinket in the refuse, why not take it?/[face:grim]I mean, I can only speak for myself, but... we're here to do a job. And a thing that once belonged to the dead is still just a thing. If it can help us, great./We're trying to save people. Defend these lands. If we find something we can use, we use it. No matter what memories are attached to it.>
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_ship=<ship.healer/goofball/romantic/poet/coward/greedy/snark/loner/60:Think about... flowers, on a grave. Who are they for? The dead can't touch them, or smell them. Wouldn't they bring more joy to the living?/[face:happy]Like why do people put flowers on graves? Same as giving them to no one. Old Grandma Skelly can't smell 'em where she's at./The dead have no need of material things. It's like... why leave flowers on a grave, where there is no one to admire them?/It's like flowers on a grave, belonging to no one. Is it not wasteful, to leave flowers where they can't be seen and smelt?/Leaving it behind would be like... putting flowers on a grave. A nice gesture, I guess, but it's not like the dead can really... do anything with them./I mean, leaving things for the dead is the same as leaving them for no one. That's why people leave flowers./I doubt the dead would mind. Just like I doubt they have any use for the flowers people heap on their graves. Flowers for no one./Leaving it would be... like leaving flowers on a grave. A nice gesture, I guess. But not really helpful./It's like, leaving flowers on a grave. What use is that? The dead will never smell them. They'll just wilt away to nothing.>
~01~prompt~panel_016~2_mystic=Huh.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_leader=<ship.rfln.leader:[face:angry]Quiet down, <ship>./Uh, <ship>? We can talk about it later./[face:grim]<ship>, love, lower your voice./> I think I've found the <foes.plural>.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_narration=In the crumbling confines of an old amphitheater, a group of <foes.Plural> mills about, unsuspecting.
~01~prompt~panel_018~2_mystic=So what's the plan?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_ship=<mystic>, <ship.rfln.mystic:make yourself useful. Bring down those pillars while we charge in./think you can bring those pillars down while we charge in?/love, can you work your magic on those pillars while we charge in?/think you can bring those pillars down while we charge in?>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=That's a lot of debris. Get a fire down there and it'll drive them right into our trap.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=<mystic> creeps along the wall to get closer to the pillars, while <ship> and <volunteer.exists:the others/<leader>> move in.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_mystic=There's <ship>'s signal. Time to go to work.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=<mystic> starts a fire. One flame is all <mystic.mf:he needs./she needs./they need.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=<leader> and <volunteer.exists:the others/<ship>> take up defensive positions.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_leader=And here they come!
