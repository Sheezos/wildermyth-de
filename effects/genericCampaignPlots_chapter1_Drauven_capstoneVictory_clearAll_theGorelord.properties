You did good, <hunter>./[face:interested]We're not who we were when we started out, are we?/Tracking them into unknown lands is a little bit more than I want for this day./There's killers whose despair is to watch their victims survive. Remember that, too./[face:interested][i]I'd[] run if the wood-rabbits started picking up swords./[face:neutral]That's pretty philosophical of you. Here, pass me your wine./[face:happy]Your scorn for them doesn't get old, <hunter>. It really doesn't./[face:neutral]There're seasons in this world that take years to pass.

That's not all Drauv-blood./They'll never look back our way without a tremble, love.[face:angry]/[face:neutral]I won the love of a <hunter.whm:great warrior./mighty hunter./myth-shaping <hunter.mf:man/woman/mystic>.> I'm proud, today./I'm ready to be away from here.

And they're running./[face:interested]The idea that Drauven would run from [i]me...[] Funny turns the world takes./[face:skeptical]We can track them, if you want. But we should take stock of what we've won, first./They do feel the same despair we do, when given cause. I find that... sad.
