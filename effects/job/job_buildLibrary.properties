.blurb=There are loose papers and books here that we can collect and catalog into a library. We may be able to learn something.
.name=Catalog Library
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=The mess at <Site> begins on the ground floor, and climbs each stair: books, volumes, ledgers, scrolls, and a horde of loose papers flapping about like nesting pigeons. If we can gather and sort them, we might be able to establish a little modest library. There may not be tons of useful knowledge here, but, then again, you never know what's under the rock until you lift it. Shall we get started?
~02~~panel_001~1_narration=<Site> now has a functional library. We've identified a couple books in particular that are worth deeper study.
