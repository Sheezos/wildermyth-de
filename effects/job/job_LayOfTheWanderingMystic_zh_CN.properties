~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=This tome was plucked from the cellar. <bookish> found it splayed open among empty barrels, webs, and the bones of a mortal soul long expired.\n\nNames are scratched into the the leather cover, names we assume stand for the book's former owners. Most are unfamiliar, but among them is one we recognize: Kralar.\n\nHeavy, stained, written in a script no one seems to understand, deciphering it will take time. But if this really did belong to the great mage, Kralar, there could be a wealth in these pages worth gleaning.
~02~~panel_001~1_narration=Blinding hours, days, have yielded nothing save a few spare passages, and the cobbled-together legend for a language that seems to mutate with each turn of a page. What we have, however, is fruit enough for ten books.\n\nThere is aught within these lines that tells of the arrival of the legendary Mystic <legend.fullName>. How <legend.mf:he/she/they> came to these lands and called them Yondering. And then it describes some basic principles of magic that old <legend.firstName> imparted.\n\nWe assume the book's author was an apprentice of sorts, though perhaps an unmagical scribe managed it. It doesn't matter.\n\nWhat matters is that one of our number has asked for the privilege of unravelling the stories and secrets inside. Who knows what new primacies and powers they could unlock?
