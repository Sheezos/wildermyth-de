~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_narration=<self> the Hunter
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_narration=<Self> the Mystic
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_self=<self> <bookish/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/greedy/poet:had a fine head for tactics and a strong fighting-arm/always found cause for laughter, but inside, <self.mf:his/her/their> heart thrilled for battle/had the hands of a healer, but a passion for the fight/felt at home in the fight, and thrived in the heat of mortal struggle/measured <self.mf:himself/herself/themself> against the warriors of legend, and sought to match them/didn't like fighting. But <self.mf:he/she/they> was a natural, moving with grace and power/bowed to an instinct for close-combat that was undeniable>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002.(self_is_coward)~1_self=And that's all well and good, but if I'm going to stand in front, I better get paid in front, too.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003.(self_is_goofball)~1_self=The life of a warrior fits me the way pants don't.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004.(self_is_loner)~1_self=This young bear will carve <self.mf:his/her/their> own path.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005.(self_is_poet)~1_self=A warrior's life is only as good as the weapons <self.mf:he/she/they> carries.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_006.(self_is_romantic)~1_self=Who will not swoon to see me dance and dare, and turn a lost fight fair?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007.(self_is_snark)~1_self=Actually, I just suck at bows and magic... So...
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_self=<self> <self.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/poet:found <self.mf:his/her/their> wisdom in the wilderness, the knowledge that lives in wood and earth./took naturally to shadows, preferring not to be seen or struck at. A hunter's life for <self.mf:him/her/them>./discovered a certain delight in stalking <self.mf:his/her/their> quarry unseen. Almost like <self.mf:he/she/they> was meant to be a hunter.../could've been a ranger by trade, skilled with woodcraft and natural medicines. <self.mf:He/She/They> became a hunter./chased anything that ran. It was <self.mf:his/her/their> nature, and made <self.mf:him/her/them> an instinctual hunter./always found a way. <self.mf:He/She/They> became a skilled guide and a renowned hunter./was a wildersoul, and took to hunting and solitude without qualm or question.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002.(self_is_coward)~1_self=Definitely standing away from the fighting and popping off arrows, though. Is the key point.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003.(self_is_goofball)~1_self=And I plan on hunting everything hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha-!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004.(self_is_loner)~1_self=I'm looking forward to the quiet country.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005.(self_is_romantic)~1_self=<self.awm:The trees love my sweet song and soft hands,The land itself loves my savage smell and sleek step>!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006.(self_is_snark)~1_self=Yeah, don't make my mistake. Major in something useful. Like swordfighting.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_self=<self> <self.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/poet:was always delving through books, searching for access to a hidden side of life./found inside <self.mf:himself/herself/themself> a frightening dark ego, and followed its often questionable advice./uncovered a talent for magic latent in <self.mf:his/her/their> able fingers. This had hilarious consequences for everyone./felt attuned to the looping life force of all things, to mending and helping it flow./understood then, why flames sometimes flew and stones shattered when the wrath rose high in <self.mf:him/her/them>./found the calling <self.mf:he/she/they> dreamed of, there in <self.mf:his/her/their> night soul. <self.mf:He/She/They> spoke owlish words, and heroes listened./tended to be a stranger, an anomally to otherfolks, and an unwelcome guest. Riddles tumored <self.mf:his/her/their> tongue.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002.(self_is_coward)~1_self=So, what does that mean? May I be excused?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003.(self_is_goofball)~1_self=By my most mystic nose, this is going to be a whole loaf of fun!
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004.(self_is_loner)~1_self=So all you other bugbears better leave me to my work.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005.(self_is_romantic)~1_self=And who doesn't want to date a <self.mf:guy who walks around in his robe all day/girl who can make things explode if she doesn't like them>?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006.(self_is_snark)~1_self=Don't worry. I won't lose control...
