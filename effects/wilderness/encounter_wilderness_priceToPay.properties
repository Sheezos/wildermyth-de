~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]What're you doing? It's locked?/[face:skeptical]Place looks pretty run down./Place's seen better days, hasn't it?>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_greedy=<leader.loner/snark/60:Weirdly, yeah./Locked up, though. Surprisingly sturdy./Door's locked. Real sturdy, too.>
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Not here to burn it down, are you?/Heyo, crowmaster. Want to roost in our windmill?/\nYou folks looking to get in the windmill?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_leader=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Not intentionally.[face:happy]/Not the comfiest roost I've ever spied./<leader.coward/greedy/healer/loner/60:Yes, <npc.mf: sir/ma'am>. Hoping to maybe fix up the place. If that's all right with you of course./Yepp, we were hoping to fix this place up and maybe get some use out of it./Not really, just curious to see an abandoned mill out here./Eh, we were just passing by and saw this rundown place. Seemed deserted and comfy./ Eh, just taking a look at the moment.>>
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_npc=<leader.themePiece_fire_leftArm/themePiece_crow_head:Heh, fair enough./Can't say I'd pick it over a nice tree./>  I'd love to see the place up and running again. That mill used to supply all of <overlandTile> with grain.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_npc=Come whispering winter or blistering summer, it'd keep spinning. Some say the spirits helped the owners keep it running, though I'd place my bets on hard work. People are so quick to give credit to the unknown.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_snark=<snark.BOOKISH/GREEDY/ROMANTIC/LONER/60:Hard work often goes unremarked. /Well, whoever built it isn't getting use out of it now./Well it's not really helping anyone now is it? This place looks closer to a bandit hideout, than a working mill./ Only spirits for company sounds like a blessing./I doubt the spirits would let  something they built end up looking so shabby.>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_npc=<snark.BOOKISH/GREEDY/ROMANTIC/LONER/60:Only by those unfamiliar with it.[face:joke]/Hey now, this old place has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. We'll see how you're looking after a few decades./Hey now, this old place has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. We'll see how you're looking after a few decades./Heh, only if they're the nice kind of spirit./Hey now, this old place has seen battles by the dozen, and people by the hundred. We'll see how you're looking after a few decades.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc=We need places like this. The windmill proves the people of <overlandTile> were here. Some folks are lucky enough to get songs written about them, others end up in stories.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_npc=Most go without a headstone to mark their death. For some, places like this are the only sign they ever lived at all.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_npc=This mill has been the home of half a dozen families. When it's gone, will the memory of them go too?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_snark=Where's the people who run this place now? What happened to them?
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_snark=Monsters, time, bandits. Take your pick.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_snark=<greedy.HOTHEAD/COWARD/BOOKISH/60:Is it really worth wasting our time on something that's going to end up ruined in a few years?/Is it really worth rebuilding something that's just going to fall apart in a few years?/This land is just going to waste with a ruined windmill sitting atop it. Why should we try fighting against the coming ages?/Should we really spend our time rebuilding something that's just going to end up ruined?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_snark=<snark.BOOKISH/GREEDY/ROMANTIC/LONER/60:By that logic, I should never read another tome for fear I'll forget it./It's a fair question. [face:interested]/The chance that things may fall apart is never an excuse to stop trying./Maybe./You use that same logic when it comes to bathing yourself <greedy>.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~4_leader=<leader.personality2: By the time I'm 60 I won't remember half of what I've read, but the act still has purpose. It needs to be done./Look if we don't try to fix it, this is just a <foes.cdgmt:Deepist base/Drauven nest/Gorgon infestation/Morthagi base/Thrixl nest> waiting to happen./The people around here need this, <greedy>, unless you want take its place. Just start swinging your arms and grinding grain./If it just sits here, it's a waste. Either it's taking up valuable land, or it's doing some good./Winter isn't going to be pretty around here without it. If we can help people by fixing this place, we should./You'd rather we just leave this ruin lying around?/Maybe we can't win against the years to come, but the people here need this. We can't stop waking up because we'll just end up asleep again./If we fix it up, we could make a home for someone here. I'm sure there's someone out there who'd enjoy some solitude./Maybe we can't win against the years to come, but the people here need this. We can't stop waking up because we'll just end up asleep again./We fix things that are broken. That's what <Company> is all about./No, we should just leave this ruin on the horizon for every wandering bandit to gather in. Great idea, <greedy>.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_greedy=Does it have to be a windmill though? Should we let something new take its place?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_snark=<snark.personality2:Let's break it down and clear out the foundation so something superior can replace it./Better open land than a monster hovel. Let's tear it down./Let's go with the smashing option./Windmills aren't that profitable anyway, let's break it down./Let's get rid of it, so something better can take its place./We should clear the land for something new./Better open land than a monster hovel. Let's tear it down./We should clear the land for something new./Let us tear down these tired stones and let something new take its place./Eh, let's trade the eye sore for an open field./Eh, let's trade the eye sore for an open field.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=Let's fix this place up. <leader.personality:The past needs to be remembered./Being forgotten sounds horrible./At least then the crows will have somewhere comfy to sleep./[bold]Someone[] should get some use out of this place./People here need to eat./I hate seeing useless broken things lying around./People here need to eat.//A shining beacon of production can feed more than the body./The past needs to be remembered./Might as well have a [bold]useful pile of rocks[bold] lying around.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_snark=<snark.personality:Sometimes we have to let go of the past, so the future can be brighter./ Could become a haunt for bandits if we just leave it. Better to clear the land./No one but ghosts left here, let's give the living a chance to make something new./If this place was so important, it'd never have ended up like this. Maybe someone else can do better here./Let's break it down so something better can take its place. The people who ran this mill saved lives, and that doesn't disappear./I hate seeing useless things lying around. Let's break it down./Let's break it down so something better can take its place. The people who ran this mill saved lives, and that doesn't disappear./It doesn't work anymore. The people who were here are gone. Let's clear it./The broken and bruised remnants of a time gone by must go, so new growth can replace it./It's a ruin. If we break it down, the land gets a fresh start./It's just taking up space. Get rid of it, maybe something useful will appear.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_npc=I suppose the people they saved are legacy enough.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=So the <company> set to dismantling these tired stones.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_narration=When they were finished, the land was clear, and room for new stories had been made.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_npc2=<npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> right. <leader.personality:A relic from the past can provide a path forward./If we just leave, bandits are just as likely to fill this place as spirits./Mill-rebuilding wasn't in the job description, but food is good./If we can repair this place, it could help us out later on./Places like this need to be cared for, just as they care for the people around them./I don't want to keep seeing an ugly stone ruin on the horizon either./Places like this need to be cared for, just as they care for the people around them.//Our world rests upon the pillars of the past, we cannot let them fail./Everyone deserves the chance to be remembered./It'd be nothing but a waste of space if we left it like this.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~2_snark=Maybe so, but we don't really have time to run an entire mill.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_npc=I guess it's my turn to leave a mark here then.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=With the help of <company>, <npc> rebuilt and refurbished the mill. It would the aid the heroes for years to come.
