.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> return to the home of the exile...
.longName=The Prisoner
.name=Result
~01~~panel_001~4_narration=The significance of the encounter will only become clear to them later.
~01~~panel_002~4_narration=<hook> and <hook2> take the long trip back to the cottage of the exile...
~01~~panel_003~4_narration=...making good time, but mulling over all they've seen and done.
~01~~panel_003~5_narration=Doubt and confusion creep over them. Still, it's not enough to turn them from their course.
~01~~panel_004~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:Here we are! Finally. We'll get your curse wiped away, <hook.goofball.60:and we can go back to hating each other in all the little ways we enjoy. I mean, this could even amplify it./and we can both get back to our normal... ultra-dangerous lives.>/<hook.healer.60:Keep your nose pointed forward, <hook2>. Look, we're finally here. Soon, no more worries. Or at least, these worries will be gone. That'll feel good, right?/Well, journey's end. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now the hermit just has to do <legend.mf:his/her/their> part.>/<hook.poet.75:I get an awful foreboding in me... Like waking up to perfect silence./I'm starting to wonder about all of this... like... what spell does the old <legend.mf:man/woman/person> plan on working? Is it going to be... good?>/--->
~01~~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Oh. You make it sound nice./Aren't you speaking too soon?/I've been feeling that way since we started this whole adventure...>
~01~~panel_006~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]What? It'll be fine./I'm speaking right on time!/No, I'm sorry. It'll be okay./---> <hook.leader/greedy/snark:Trust me./We fulfilled our side of the bargain./I mean, you're not going to tell me that <legend> the Exile was behind it all from the beginning, are you?>
~01~~panel_007~1_legend=Fast! A pair of pennywits comes a-calling! Oo, I feel an itch in my old feathernicks!
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=<legend>! We're back.
~01~~panel_009~1_legend=I know. Do I have to repeat that thing about my feathernicks?
~01~~panel_010~1_hook=Here it is. The dwemerald you sent us for. <hook.bookish/coward/goofball/poet/romantic/snark:It's undeniably fascinating. What does it do?/It's heavy. [face:skeptical]Makes me nervous, being honest./[face:skeptical]It's definitely got that magic-type glow./It glimmers like a captured star, doesn't it?/It's beautiful. A wedding-gem, is what it puts me in mind of./It's certainly glowy. Fetch a price, I'm sure.>
~01~~panel_011~1_narration=<hook> displays the dwemerald they found buried under the hero's statue. In the air it glows green and lowly pulses with sound, like the beating of vast wings in an otherwise silent sky.
~01~~panel_012~1_legend=Yes... that's the stone we need...
~01~~panel_012~2_hook2=How did you hear of this thing? You realize what we had to do to get it?
~01~~panel_013~2_hook2=Yeah.
~01~~panel_014~1_legend=Wasn't it just buried in some old hero's tomb?
~01~~panel_016~3_legend=Right, well... But come inside, we'll set to work.
~01~~panel_017~3_narration=Back in the exile's windowless cottage, <legend.mf:he takes/she takes/they take> the jewel and <legend.mf:coaxes/coaxes/coax> open a sleepy old tome. Translucent pages whisper by. Old silvery ink gleams in candlelight.
~01~~panel_018~3_hook=Curses aren't something we normally see, you know? How hard is this?
~01~~panel_019~4_legend=Yes, casting one is easier than removing one. The way releasing a bird from a cage is easier than getting it back inside. Well, and that's depending on the cage, I should say...
~01~~panel_020~5_hook2=<hook2.whm://What exactly will you be bonding with?>
~01~~panel_020~6_hook=<hook.whm://<hook2.whm:What exactly will you be bonding with?/What exactly will you be bonding with?/>>
~01~~panel_020~7_legend=I must fuse with the jewel... and with you <hook2>.\nI'm ready, now. Allow me to reach out to you...
~01~~panel_021~3_narration=But it seems too late for mistrust.
~01~~panel_022~3_narration=The implications of such a thing aren't entirely clear.
~01~~panel_023~3_narration=<legend>'s face goes blank for a moment, and the interfusion forms, first between <legend.mf:him/her/them> and the stone, next bringing <hook2> in and locking them together in a strange wobbly light...
~01~~panel_024~3_narration=<hook2> feels a shadow presence exit <hook2.mf:his/her/their> body... leaving <hook2.mf:his/her/their> heart and mind clear...
~01~~panel_024~8_narration=There's a smell of fresh blood.
~01~~panel_025~3_narration=For a moment, pain contorts <legend>'s face and wild colors swirl under <legend.mf:his/her/their> skin.
~01~~panel_026~3_narration=And then the shadow passes into the jewel.
~01~~panel_027~3_narration=The bonds interfusing them fade away...
~01~~panel_028~2_legend=It's... done.
~01~~panel_029~2_legend=I'm free!
~01~~panel_029~3_narration=<legend.mf:He drops/She drops/They drop> the jewel and gleefully crushes it beneath <legend.mf:his/her/their> foot.
~01~~panel_029~8_action=[white] crnch!
~01~~panel_030~4_narration=Next, the house explodes.
~01~~panel_030~5_action=[actionLarge]WHHooOOOM!!
~01~~panel_031~4_narration=<legend> stands tall amid the wreckage.
~01~~panel_031~5_legend=Ah, delicious morons! Flagrant fools! \nFeel this moment. [i]Remember[] this moment!
~01~~panel_031~6_hook2=<legend>, what...?
~01~~panel_032~5_legend=Oh, please, not <legend>! Call me Vulta! <legend.mf:Lord/Queen/Lord> Vulta of Graymountain!
~01~~panel_033~2_legend=For I am the Vulture <legend.mf:Lord himself/Queen herself/Lord themself>!
~01~~panel_035~5_legend=Allow me to explain. In the days before the rise of the Treetalkers, the Starwatchers, or the Wavewandering Poets...
~01~~panel_036~1_self=In those scorched and beautiful days, I was Vulta of Graymountain, who conquered all the lands and peoples within my span.
~01~~panel_037~1_self=My soldiers were strong and plentiful as the stones. I stooped over every town, farm, and tower, plucked every gobbet of joy that pleased me!
~01~~panel_038~1_legend=And my reign would've lasted forever, if not for a certain... acne-scarred... thing. A <hero.mf:guy/lady/person> is what <hero.mf:he was/she was/they were>. <hero.mf:Ansel Aristallas, his/Aria Anistallas, her/Ansel Aristallas, their> awful and cumbersome name. Disguised, <hero.mf:he/she/they> came to me with a beautiful jewel. Lied to me! And as I looked upon the gem, <hero.mf:he/she/they> spoke a rhyme...
~01~~panel_038~nameTag_1=The One With The Ample Bottom
~01~~panel_039~1_legend=My immortal soul poured from me. My essence was imprisoned within the jewel for eternity, leaving my body... this shell you see before you... powerless, but alive.
~01~~panel_040~5_legend=Over so many millennia, I roved. For untold stretches of time, I was so weak I could barely eat. But I did hunger. Hunger was all I had...
~01~~panel_041~8_legend=But then, things changed.
~01~~panel_041~9_hook2=It was you, wasn't it?
~01~~panel_042~2_legend=Yes! Around the time you were a child, <hook2>, a mighty quake split the earth. The sealed chamber where <hero.mf:Aristallas/Anistallas/Aristallas> was buried with my powers must've broken. This allowed some of my strength to seep back to me...
~01~~panel_044~3_legend=Unfortunately the hallowed tomb still repelled my gaze, my steps, my efforts to attack it... Only someone with good intentions would be able to remove the jewel.
~01~~panel_045~1_legend=Ingeniously, then, I laid a curse on a child. One destined to be a hero, one capable of seeking out and exhuming the gem. Once retrieved, I would bind the curse into the prison in place of my own soul... freeing me entirely and at last.
~01~~panel_046~7_hook2=Then it all began, and ends, with you.
~01~~panel_047~9_legend=Oh, trust me. Nothing's close to ending. Soon enough, your whole world will be reborn.
~01~~panel_048~4_narration=As they move to attack...
~01~~panel_049~10_action=whff!
~01~~panel_049~4_narration=...the <legend.mf:man/woman/person> is gone.
~01~~panel_050~1_hook=The <legend.mf:Vulture Lord/Vulture Queen/Vulture Lord> has been unleashed!
