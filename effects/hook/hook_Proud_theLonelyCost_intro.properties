.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> went in search of an exile...
.longName=The Prisoner
.name=Opportunity
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=<hook2> never told anyone.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=In fact, <hook2.mf:he/she/they> often wondered whether it had truly happened at all.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=A deathcurse had been laid on <hook2.mf:his head as a boy/her head as a girl/their head as a child>...
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_narration=...the words of some weird <legend.mf:warlock/witch/warlock> whose wrath had been stirred.
~01~prompt~panel_002~3_narration=A vulture voice shrieked in <hook2>'s sleep, returning \neach year on the night of a shadowed moon.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_narration=Many years went by.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_narration=As <season>s piled up, <hook2> began to feel a clutching hand at <hook2.mf:his/her/their> heart.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=Death might come any night, now, it seemed.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_narration=So at last <hook2.mf:he/she/they> confided in someone.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose the person <hook2.mf:he/she/they> thought least likely to care. This person would make the soundest decisions, <hook2.mf:he/she/they> supposed./<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose a friend, a <hook.mf:man/woman/person> with whom <hook2.mf:he/she/they>'d fought battles, and beaten dire odds./<hook2.mf:He/She/They> chose the person <hook2.mf:he/she/they> cared for most of all./-->
~01~prompt~panel_006~4_hook=Cottage is just up this way.
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_narration=They travel to the whispered home of an exile, an old mystic reputed to have studied curses and their counters.
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hook2=I do wonder...
~01~prompt~panel_007~4_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Of course you do./[face:skeptical]What?/[face:sad]Yes, love?/>
~01~prompt~panel_008~3_hook2=Well, there's a reason exiles got [i]exiled[], right?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.bookish/hothead/loner/60:Granted. But let's also remember that those we ostracize tend to possess knowledge we ourselves lack access to. Desperate times demand [i]disparate[] wisdom./Because other folks are scared of them. That means they must be capable of something others aren't./Exiles are often just people who made too much sense, too publicly./Hard to argue that point. But we ourselves aren't exactly welcome everywhere, are we? This's the best thing I could think of...>
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hook2=What's <legend.mf:his/her/their> name?
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hook=Uh, the one I heard was [i]<legend.fullname>...
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_legend=Hellooo...??
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_legend=Hello?? I heard my name.
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_legend=Shadowfond night things, moonwalkers and lostlings, if you creep hungry to my cottage door, away again! I'm no morsel for a tooth, nor treasure for a oh...
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_narration=The <legend.mf:man/woman/person> shines a light on their faces.
~01~prompt~panel_015~3_legend=Two couth travelers! Ahoo, ahoo. Come inside. It's late, but I've got eggs!
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_narration=They tell this exiled mystic about <hook2>'s curse as <legend.mf:he fries/she fries/they fry> eggs in a bluish bath of milk, salt, and crushed herbs.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_legend=Curses, hexes, are really extensions of nature. Agents of a wild will. Like beasts, like fire. Eating. Breathing. Destroying.
~01~prompt~panel_018~1_legend=Once a curse is spun into motion, it follows the course of chaos. The trick then is to trap it. To lure it out of the life it circles, and bind it within a prison.
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_legend=Sure, I know how to do this. But the cost is always steep.
~01~prompt~panel_020~2_hook=<hook.bookish/coward/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]We're low on alternatives, so... I think we'll do what you propose?/Well, we don't have a lot of choice. It's nothing too extraordinary, I hope?[face:interested]/Well, name a price. I'm sure we can work something out./We can get just about anything we want. What'll it take?/[face:grim]That's unsurprising. What'll it take?/[face:skeptical]We're low on options. What kind of price are we talking?/[face:grim]We can handle most things. What do you need?>
~01~prompt~panel_022~3_legend=For this... there's somewhere you must go...
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_narration=They set out again in the morning, to find what the <legend.mf:man/woman/person> has bid them fetch.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook2=Something about the way <legend.mf:he/she/they>... it feels [i]off[]. I'll find another answer.
~04~prompt~panel_001~1_hook=Who will accompany <hook> and <hook2>? You can take one additional hero.
