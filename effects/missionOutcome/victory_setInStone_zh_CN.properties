~01~~panel_004~1_healer=<healer.bookish/goofball/healer:None of us. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They've> been dead at least a day./Wasn't us. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They're> stiffer than an ironwood board! Been here a bit./Peace, <leader>, it wasn't one of us. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They've> been dead at least a day. >

~01~~panel_008~1_healer=<healer.healer/snark/coward:Got it! It's some sort of key. I've never seen one with so many teeth before!/Got it! It's just a funky looking key. Not sure that was worth the effort./Got it! It's a really strange looking key. Maybe something killed <npc.mf:him/her/them> for it.>
