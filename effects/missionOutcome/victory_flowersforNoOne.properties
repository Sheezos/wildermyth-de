~01~prompt~panel_001~1_mystic=Yeah. <mystic.rfln.ship:[face:skeptical]Just try not to get in my way next time./[face:default]We did it. And <ship>, thanks for having my back./[face:default]You okay?/--->
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_ship=<ship.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/healer/snark/60:[face:grim]Phew. Was that the last one?/And we're done. No more uglies./[face:angry]That it? We're done?/[face:grim]Alright. That's the last of them./Is it over?/[face:dubious]We done here?/Was that the last of them?>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_ship=<mystic.rfln.ship:<ship.goofball/healer/leader/60:[face:skeptical]Huh? I thought we were dance fighting./[face:dubious]Oh sure. Don't know what I was thinking, trying to help you out./[face:dubious]Oh sure. You would've preferred for that <threat.singular> to take you out?/[face:skeptical]I think you have that backwards.>/<ship.healer/leader/loner/goofball/greedy/snark/60:Hey, just doing my job./We had each other's backs./Just doing my job./Well, I wasn't going to let that <threat.singular> have it./Well, it'd be real boring without you. Couldn't let that happen./[face:skeptical]Well, it'd be real boring without you. Couldn't let that happen./What're friends for, right?>/<ship.romantic/hothead/poet/coward/60:<mystic>, I'm with you... in some quaint old ruins. Couldn't be happier./Me? What's a few scrapes and bruises, long as I'm with you?/<mystic>, I'm with you... in some quaint old ruins. Couldn't be happier./[face:interested]Oh, um... I [i]do[] have a few scrapes and bruises. But I'm just glad we're both safe./I'm still standing. And so are you. That's what matters.>/--->
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_leader=<mystic.rfln.ship:Hey. Before you two start squabbling again, look at this./<leader.snark/goofball/hothead/loner/60:[face:skeptical]Not to break up the mutual back-patting society, but look what I found./Hey, one of you friendlies. I found this thing./Hey, you two. Look at this./Um, not to interrupt, but... found something./Hey, you two, I found something over here.>/Hey, lovebirds. Look what I found./Hey, look what I found.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_ship=Should we check it out?
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_leader=Stairwell. Pretty sure the <threat.plural> were using it.
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_mystic=What's? Oh...
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_narration=Down they climb, into the ancient city's underbelly. Slimy things skitter away at their approach. A rancid odor hangs in the air.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_mystic=Ow! That's my foot you're stepping on.
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:skeptical]Really? That lumpy thing?/[face:interested]Oh, sorry. Can't see a thing./Sorry. Don't want to lose you in the dark./--->
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_leader=Think I found a torch. Give me a moment...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_ship=<ship.greedy/60:A treasure hoard?/A storage room?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_mystic=<mystic.goofball/snark/coward/60:[face:skeptical]<ship.greedy/60:A hoard of coffins, more like./Yeah, for storing coffins.>/[face:skeptical]<ship.greedy/60:Or a hoard of coffins. As in, a crypt./Yes. For storing your dead. As in, a crypt.>/[face:interested]Uh, I think those are coffins. This... must be a crypt?/No. Those are coffins against the wall. It's a crypt.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=Flowers were once strewn across the floor. Shriveled to husks, most have been crushed to a fine powder beneath trampling feet, mingling now with scattered bones.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_narration=The offerings, what's left of them, were mostly plain, ordinary objects. A favorite vase or a worn out quill.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_narration=Small tokens. Memories of the dead.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_mystic=Everything's been picked through.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_leader=<leader.bookish/coward/loner/greedy/60:[face:skeptical]Mm. They had ample time to take what they wanted. And no qualms about destroying what they didn't./Well... they were here for a long time, probably. Taking whatever they wanted./[face:grim]Mm. Had this place to themselves. Took what they wanted./[face:grim]Guess they had plenty of time. Got to all the best stuff./They had plenty of time to take what they wanted.>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_ship=Here's something they didn't ruin.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_mystic=<mystic.bookish/healer/leader/loner/60:It's a shame. Some of these artifacts might've shed some light on the history of their makers. Count on the <threat.plural> to ruin everything./These poor people... to have their bones and their belongings... Ugh. <threat.plural> ruin everything./If only we'd gotten here sooner... maybe we could have stopped the <threat.plural> before they ruined everything./Guess it's no surprise. <threat.plural> ruin everything./This painting... they tore it to shreds to get at something in the frame. Ugh. <threat.plural> ruin everything.>
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_narration=In a dark corner, beside a broken sarcophagus, a mystic's staff lies among the rubble.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_mystic=Yeah. It looks... special...
~01~prompt~panel_017~2_ship=<ship.bookish/greedy/coward/romantic/60:It's an unusual shape. Most likely belonged to an eminent magician./Looks well made. Think it's valuable?/[face:grim]Must've fallen out of the coffin when they.../This must be the tomb of some powerful wizard. A hero of old times./Must've belonged to whoever was buried here.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_mystic=<mystic.greedy/healer/leader/poet/romantic/hothead/60:And it's got my name written all over it./We could use it to help people./We should take it. To protect the living./It has stories yet to tell. In our hands./Maybe we were meant to find it. To wield it in our fight./Would be a waste to leave it behind./<ship> was right. The living need it more than the dead.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_mystic=<mystic.greedy/bookish/coward/hothead/60:Never thought I'd say this... but I think it belongs here./It [i]is[] tempting, but this is where it belongs./Uh, I don't know. Seems like... it belongs here./Glad it survived. Just don't think it belongs with us./I feel like... this is where it belongs.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=<mystic> stoops and takes hold of the staff, wriggling it free of the rubble.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=It's heavy in <mystic.mf:his/her/their> hands. No scuffs or scratches mar its surface. Nor any sign of time's decay
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_narration=They put out the torch. Make their way back to the surface.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~3_narration=And push some loose boulders over the passage.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:dubious]Uh, <mystic>? We're done. It's secure. Let's go./<mystic>? You ready to go?/Ready, love?/You ready?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_mystic=Hmm, yeah.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_mystic=<mystic.greedy/hothead/poet/romantic/snark/60:[face:joy]Thanks, ancient people. Nice city you had. Maybe I'll come back someday./[face:happy]Hey, thanks, whoever you were./[face:grim]Thank you, ancient ones. May your rest never be disturbed again./[face:happy]Thanks, whoever you were. Maybe through our deeds, your legacy will live on./[face:skeptical]Well thanks, whoever you were. Try not to get into any more trouble with the <threat.plural>./[face:happy]Thanks... whoever you were. We won't forget you.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~3_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:skeptical]/[face:happy]/[face:happy]/>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:<ship.greedy/snark/leader/healer/60:Come on, really? It's a perfectly good staff. Could even sell it if you don't need it./Oh yeah? Your funny bone tells you these dead people are going to need it?/[face:skeptical]Aren't you being overly sentimental? If the company could use it.../I get that it feels weird. But if we can use it.../Belongs? What good do you think it'll do if we leave it?>/<ship.goofball/coward/greedy/hothead/60:[face:interested]Hmm, really? You think one of these dead guys might need it?/[face:grim]But... couldn't we use it? Who knows how many more battles are ahead.../[face:surprised]Uh, <mystic>, really? I mean... it's a perfectly good staff./[face:surprised]Wait, really? I mean, couldn't we use it?/[face:grim]I get it, <mystic>. But if we leave it behind...>/<ship.greedy/hothead/bookish/60:[face:grim]Uh, <mystic>, you sure you're thinking this through?/[face:surprised]Wait, really? Don't you want to use it to smash up some.../[face:grim]<mystic>, I know where you're coming from. But it could be a powerful tool.../[face:grim]I get it, <mystic>. But if we leave it behind...>/--->
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_mystic=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:grim]I know, I know. It's like leaving flowers for no one. Or whatever./Maybe it's silly... like leaving flowers for no one./Sorry, <ship>. It's probably silly, like leaving flowers for no one./>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_mystic=<mystic.greedy/snark/hothead/loner/coward/60:Normally I'd be the first to snatch up a rare treasure. But... there's so little left of these people. It'd be like stealing the last beam holding up someone's house, just to mend your picket fence./But really, it's just a staff. Not going to turn the tide either way. No need to risk incurring some angsty ghost's wrath./But, look. Seeing what the <threat.plural> did, it makes me angry. Course we're not evil like them. I just... want to leave these people something that's still whole./But the <threat.plural> already looted this place. So I... don't want to take anything more from them./But it's only a staff. Probably not going to make a big difference for us, really. And, who knows, the thing could be cursed./But the <threat.plural> already looted this place. Sure, we could put it to good use, but we don't need it. We'll find other treasures along our way. I just want to leave them something that's still whole.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~2_leader=<leader.rfln.mystic:[face:dubious]Well alright. Just don't try to tell me you changed your mind once we're on the road./<leader.healer/loner/greedy/60:[face:happy]I'm with you. Hey, why don't we clean this place up before we go?/[face:grim]Yeah. That's fair. So... should we clean up a bit, before we go?/[face:skeptical]Well, I suppose that's fine, if you're sure. Uh, guess we could tidy up a bit before we go?/Alright, <mystic>, if you're sure. Think maybe we should tidy this place up before we go?>/[face:happy]That's the <mystic> I fell for. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we clean this place up before we go?/Well, alright. If you're sure. Say, why don't we tidy this place up before we go?>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=<leader.rfln.mystic:<ship> suggests they tidy things up before they go. ///>They clear out the rubble. Return the bones to the coffins. Sweep away the dust.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_narration=<mystic> lays the staff near the bones of its likely master.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_ship=<ship.rfln.mystic:[face:skeptical]Hey, <mystic>. Time to go./Let's go, <mystic>./Ready, love?/Let's go, <mystic>.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_007~3_narration=On their way out, they seal the passage with some loose boulders.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_narration=Leaving the dead to resume their interrupted slumber.
